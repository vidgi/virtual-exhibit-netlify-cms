### TRISTAN SAUER

In the original narrative of the golem, a mythical being of clay is brought to life through magic to serve humankind. Our present-day parallel to this figure is the robot, a being of metal brought to life by technology similarly to serve humankind. Both beings reflect human interests and imaginaries; the golem is dreamt into existence by way of magic, and the robot is a simulation of our own reality. 

The 2021 IA Current exhibition will explore the dreams and simulations of the computer age, and how they attempt to imagine new methods of digital co-existence and the future of our world. The	show	will	draw	parallels	between	our	dreams	and	the	simulations	we	create	digitally	through	video	game	worlds,	
online	chatbots,	web	VR,	and	avatars.	It	will	question	how	we	can	learn	about	ourselves and	our	relations	to	others	from	these	simulated	realities.	Eroding	the	dichotomy	of	the	real	and	the	virtual,	this	exhibition	explores	digital	co-existence	and	the	futurity	of	internet	culture,	with	the	aim	of	envisioning	more	equitable,	diverse,	and	safe	futures	online.

In	the	exhibitionâ€™s	call	for	works,	Sauer	asks	artists:	how	can	we	imagine	more	ethical	online	futures?	How	can	we	avoid	the	mistakes	of	the	physical	world	on	the	web?	What	is	a	simulation	if	not	a	computerized	dream?	What	is	a	dream	if	not	a	psychological	simulation?	Can	computers	dream	and	if	they	can,	of	what?	Is	the	brain	a	computer?	Where	does	the	threshold	between	digital	and	physical	exist?

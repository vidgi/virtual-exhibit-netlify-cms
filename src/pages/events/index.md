### Performances — _Arcadia Inc. Live_

_Arcadia Inc._ is a work of speculative fiction which responds to the use of landscape photography as a carrier for brand ideologies, on the computer desktop and beyond. The fictional company proposes the synthetic landscape as a “clean, context-free alternative to nature imagery”. This work calls attention to a devastating history of Western landscape representation – in paintings, writing, or photographs – often historically used as a way to assert power over a place and a people.

In this recurring Twitch-streamed performance piece, virtual landscape is explored and documented by bots (“agents”) who capture landscape photographs of this synthetic world. These images are uploaded, in real time, to the exhibition website at sculptedandforged.com/arcadia-inc where they will remain viewable for the remainder of the exhibition.

### Curator Talk — _Sculpted in Our Image, Forged in Our Minds_

Join IA Current curator Tristan Sauer for a virtual tour and discussion of the virtual exhibition _Sculpted in Our Image, Forged in Our Minds_. 

This exhibition, featuring works by Sarah Boo, Mads Brimble, Benjamin Chang, Cezar Mocan, and Andy Wallace, explores the dreams and simulations of the computer age, and how they attempt to imagine new methods of digital co-existence, with the aim of envisioning more equitable, diverse, and safe futures online.

#### About Tristan Sauer

TRISTAN SAUER is a new media artist and curator critically interested in work focused on technology and capitalism. His work explores the intersections between our digital and physical worlds, and how technology affects the various facets of human existence. Often expressed through his own identity as an Afro-Canadian, Sauer explores these topics through both an Afro-futuristic and Afro-Pessimistic lens, as well as opening up room for other marginalized voices to do the same. He graduated from the New Media program at X University, has displayed at the Plumb in Toronto, and curates as part of Long Winter.

### Screening + Discussion — Primordial Dismemberment, _Sadovnik_ (2021)

Join us for a virtual screening and discussion with artist duo Primordial Dismemberment (Thomas L. Archambault and Manolis Daris).

_Sadovnik_ (2021) is a short film shot in black in white with stereo sound. The story follows the titular character, an A.I. charged with maintaining livable environmental conditions on a remote space colony, after it awakes from a forced shutdown and discovers that all of the colony's human inhabitants have disappeared. Through its disembodied gaze, we see the empty greenhouses and the logs of the departed crew as it searches for clues that might explain their sudden departure. As the film progresses, more and more evidence is collected, building a picture of a complex series of misunderstandings between humans and machines, where the dream of transcending the limitations of our biology has rapidly turned into a nightmare. Shot in various locations in Montreal that echo with the haunting presence of lost futures, the film explores the idea of artificial intelligence as a ghost, a final manifestation both of our longing for a disincarnate, objective point of view and of deep-ecological fantasies of non-intervention vis-à-vis nature.

#### About Primordial Dismemberment

PRIMORDIAL DISMEMBERMENT is a video art duo founded in Montreal in 2019 by Thomas L. Archambault and Manolis Daris, both studio arts graduates at Concordia University. In their first work as a collective, the science-fiction short film Sadovnik, artificial intelligence becomes a fantomatic relic of the Earth and of humanity, in a future where both their fates are uncertain. Following the reception of a research and creation grant from the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec in 2020, the duo has begun working on a second film; a dystopian epic that tells the story of the pre-socratic philosopher Empedocles’ future reincarnations. Their work has previously been shown at the Centre des arts actuels Skol in Montreal.

statement: >
    Pac-Tracer is a programatic animation that examines the elegance and liveliness of the original Pac-Man AI, developed in 1980, by following the paths of Pac-Man and the four ghosts through an extruded 3D maze. Pac-Manâ€™s AI represents some of the earliest and still most compelling work in games AI, with simple rules evoking the sense that each ghost has its own personality and own predispositions for mischief. The rules that define the ghost movement are not truly adversarial: rather, they are about spatial desires. Each ghost has a place they want to be relative to Pac-Man and their fellow ghosts. This project allows those desires to play out unfettered by concerns about gamestate, or for that matter, any human interloper. By tracing those paths through the maze, the idiosyncrasies and personalities emerging from those rules become clear. What was a hunt now looks more like a waltz of attraction.

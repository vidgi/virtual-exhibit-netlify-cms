statement: >
    Antechamber is a series of interconnected rooms that allude to our perception of choice. Architectural thresholds enact as unmanifested potentials that are revealed through the agency of the experiencer. All forms of encounter can only be relative to the deep-seated nothingness at our point of origin (0,0,0). With the opening of each door, the novelty of perception emerges. Amidst the seeming chaos of being, there are coordinates on the fabric of time that ask us to reflect upon the space we embody and the spaces that surround us. In the end, the question of choice is to be questioned â€“ as all paths converge and all things connect.
bio: >
  BENJAMIN CHANG is a 3D artist and architectural designer working with digital media, spatial perception, geometry, and ritual practices as storytelling devices that question our innate ontological dilemmas. Deeply invested in the social and philosophical vision of Cosmopolitanism, his practice aims to dissolve the culturally imposed boundaries embedded in the superstructure of materialism. Perplexed by the representations of reality, he is on a journey to catalog the matrix. Chang holds a Master of Architecture from the University of Toronto and a Bachelor of Design from OCAD University.

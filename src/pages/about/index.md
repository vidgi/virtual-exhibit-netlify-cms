### ABOUT INTERACCESS

Founded in 1983 as Toronto Community-Videotex, InterAccess is a gallery, educational facility, production studio, festival, and registered charity dedicated to new media and emerging practices in art and technology.

InterAccess’s mission is to expand the cultural significance of art and technology by fostering and supporting the full cycle of art and artistic practice through education, production, and exhibition.

We envision an environment in which:
- Art that engages technology gains widespread cultural resonance;
- Critical discourse around technologies is catalyzed by artists, curators, and cultural workers;
- The full life cycle of art and artists is nurtured.

Annually we execute multiple exhibitions, a full curriculum of skill-building and critical theory workshops, and a broad range of discursive events that explore the impact of technology on the social, political and cultural aspects of contemporary life. Our studio space facilitates the circulation of skills and techniques required to produce the work we exhibit in our gallery space.

### ABOUT IA CURRENT

The InterAccess Current (IA Current) program supports the professional development of emerging curators and artists interested in new media and electronic practices. Each year, InterAccess selects an emerging curator, who works closely with InterAccess staff to conceptualize and execute an exhibition of works by emerging artists. “Current” refers to the now, of course, but it is also an energetic charge that causes light, heat and all manner of electronic life; an apt metaphor for emergent creative practices within the ever-expanding field of new media.

### ABOUT THE CURATOR

TRISTAN SAUER is a new media artist and curator critically interested in work focused on technology and capitalism. His work explores the intersections between our digital and physical worlds, and how technology affects the various facets of human existence. Often expressed through his own identity as an Afro-Canadian, Sauer explores these topics through both an Afro-futuristic and Afro-Pessimistic lens, as well as opening up room for other marginalized voices to do the same. He graduated from the New Media program at X University, has displayed at the Plumb in Toronto, and curates as part of Long Winter.

### ABOUT THE DESIGNER/DEVELOPER

VIDYA GIRI is an artist/designer/engineer based in Houston, TX. Her work and current explorations revolve around the interactions between human-synthesized creations and their environments along with experimental digital aesthetics. Across various forms of experience, she creates works with experimental visual media and technology. 

She has designed and developed this exhibition around the concept that, "machinery and technology are similar to the narrative of the golem: where clay is brought to life by magic to serve humankind". Similarly, the mesh forms used in this exhibition are sculpted from a digital ball of clay and allude to the underlying technical and societal frameworks that computers are built from and the digital presence of the featured works.

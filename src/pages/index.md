  title: Sculpted in Our Image, Forged in Our Minds
  description: >
    Inspired by the myth of the golem and the robot, both reflections of humanity’s dreams and simulations, the exhibition will explore what we can learn about our world and relationships to others from simulated realities. Eroding the dichotomy of the physical and the virtual, this exhibition explores the dreams and simulations of the computer age, and how they attempt to imagine new methods of digital co-existence, with the aim of envisioning more equitable, diverse, and safe futures online.
description: Through virtual environments, digital beings, and generative simulations artists Sarah Boo, Mads Brimble, Benjamin Chang, Cezar Mocan, and Andy Wallace explore the parallels between our dreams and simulations, and the wider implications between our physical and digital worlds.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
